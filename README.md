Title - Smart Waste Management System using IoT.


With the goal of efficiently collecting dry waste, this project presents a comprehensive
smart waste management system. The system's ability to monitor dry waste levels in bins
accurately and consistently is largely dependent on the integration of infrared (IR) sensors
with a precise range. Through real-time monitoring and management capabilities, the
system makes use of Internet of Things (IoT) technology to optimize waste collection
processes. Planning ahead and streamlining waste collection routes are made possible by
the infrared (IR) sensors' continual data collecting on fill levels, which are calibrated with
exact range parameters. Additionally, the project places a strong emphasis on using the
data from these smart bins to optimize garbage collection routes for the timely pickup of
municipal solid waste in various smart city locations. Hazardous gas sensor integration
further improves environmental safety by identifying possible threats and enabling quick
response times. The system seeks to improve environmental sustainability initiatives in
metropolitan areas by optimizing trash management procedures and utilizing cutting-edge
sensor-based monitoring in conjunction with Internet of Things technology.
